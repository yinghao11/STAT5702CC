This project is to visualize data points in 3D and visualize the potential relationship between dimensions.
I hope to introduce some tool for data visualization in python which is highly used in other modeling tasks.
Instead of visualize 2D data, I wish to introduce methods to plot data distribution and linear relationships in 3D space.
